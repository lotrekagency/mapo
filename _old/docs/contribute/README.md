# How to  contribute

Feel free to contribute to the project by making a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Here's an example for a branch naming:
`feature/<branch name>`

Once you're done with your work and are ready to make a Pull Request, set the reviewers to 
Gabriele Baldi (bnznamco) and Andrea Morosi (andreamorosi).
