# Components ðŸ§°


Here we will describe the behavior of the Mapo components.

Mapo includes and makes extensive use of the [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) component library.

Many components inherit event and slot properties from this library.

We will try to refer to the library documentation when explaining each component directly descended from one of [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/).
